netassess-new
=============

This is Mike Rizzo's netassess package, updated to work in new versions of R. It is still a work in progress. 

For some reason, one of the packages required by netassess does not come in binary form, If you are using Windows you will need to run the following command before installing the netassess-new package:

```install.packages("gpclib", type = "source")```

You can then install netassess-new from github with the following command:

```devtools::install_github("netassess-new", "ebailey78")```
